# User Experience Ethics in the future (Commerce edition)

### UX Design is a hot topic in the commerce world, but as customer expectations, technologies and markets change, so does the way we design for users.

1. New tech means new designs - robotics, AR - how do we protect customers, keep them safe?

2. AI and ML means we have more power than ever to influence customers - so we need to wield it responsibly

3. Customers expect more products to be available to them at a quicker rate. How can we encourage users to slow down, for their own health?

4. Dark patterns are becoming ever more common. Web designers and UXers are at the forefront to deal with this issue

5. Screen time - the general scientific agreement is that we need less of it. How can we make purchasing and browsing a quicker and more background process, so we can spend more time away from the screen while still being able to perform online activities we need to? (IoT, buttons, automation)

6. Customer attention spans are being shorter, and more and more users are making mistakes or being tricked into upsells or bonus purchases without intending to. How can we design intentionally so that users are more informed and aware, and encouraged to stay focussed throughout the process without overloading them with options/information?

7. Using research responsibly. 

8. Ethical companies are booming. They create extremely loyal communities with high net promoter scores. It's also in the interest of businesses and brands to act ethically, responsibility, and admit when they have made a mistake, or are learning from an experience. It's been demonstrated time and time again on Instagram and other social medias that company transparency and honesty is highly valued.

9. Don't use data irresponsibly. With the ability now to collect so much user information, security has never been more important. It's a good idea to advocate to users to keep their data secure, and what measures you are taking to achieve that.
10. Market, advertise responsibly. With screens and exposure available everywhere, you should act in the best interest of your customers. Blasting them with high contrast, noisy or distracting campaigns at all times of the day is not helping them or you.

11. Write a privacy policy or terms & conditions policy that people can actually read and understand. For nice examples, look to:
