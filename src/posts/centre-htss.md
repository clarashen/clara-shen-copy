## About HTSS Centre

The Centre for High Throughput Screening Studies at [IBCH PAS](https://portal.ichb.pl/en) was established in 2018 to create a first high-throughput screening academic infrastructure in Poland. Its construction was supported by the funding from the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (2018-2023) within a project [POL-OPENSCREEN](pol-openscreen.pl/), which brings together 7 institutions in Poland. Currently, it is the most advanced academic research infrastructure in Poland for a large-scale search of biologically active compounds. We are also a certified partner site of [EU-OPENSCREEN](https://www.eu-openscreen.eu/about/about-eu-openscreen-eric.html) European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) of >20 partners from 12 countries. 

Our key features include:

* Unique, one-of-a-kind autonomous laboratory built around robotic, automated AGAMEDE®  system supported by AI  for high-throughput and efficient mixtures optimisation
* Interdisciplinary team with extensive international experience 
* Strong focus on the development of new assays and screening technologies
* Access to infrastructure and expertise for a wide range of projects (biochemical and cellular assays, high-content and combinatorial screening) with a unique profile in high-content screening, nucleic acids binders and plant cells-based projects
* Consulting in preparation of grant applications, designing R&D campaigns and creation of screening facilities.

###### AGAMEDE® is a prototype built by an interdisciplinary team of dr Radosław Pilarski from IBCH PAS and supported by three technological partners: Mitsubishi, Perlan and Labomatica. The construction of the system was funded within an EPiCELL project led by prof. dr hab. Wojciech Markiewicz, together with prof dr hab. Maciej Stobiecki, prof. dr hab. Jan Barciszewski – all from IBCH PAS – and prof. dr hab. Maciej Kurpisz – IHG PAS, and funded by NCBiR through STRATEGMED programme.


## My role

* Designing and constructing of state-of-the-art research infrastructure for chemical biology
* Managing the budget of 12.6 mln PLN
* Setting up short and long-term development plans for the Centre
* Building and coordinating a work of interdisciplinary team of chemists, biologists, informaticians, automation specialists as well as administrative, communication and legal specialists
* Establishing formal framework and practical procedures regulating the activity of the centre (including statutes, accessibility 
* Negotiating interests of various stakeholders (scientists, management of the institute, industrial partners, funding agencies, external academic collaborators)
* Creating a network of users and partners (national and international)

## Work

The creation of the Centre began in 2018 and in January 2020, despite still ongoing efforts of extending it and optimising its functioning (planned to be achieved by May 2023), we were able to commence the first R&D projects. Since this moment (within one year) we have successfully recruited 12 projects (of which 4 are focussed on COVID-19-based research) with 6 additional being in the review by funding agencies and 5 at the stage of discussion with the partners. We are also currently running 3 internal projects aimed at development of new screening technologies. 

At the moment, we are further developing our infrastructure, recruiting new projects, promoting it in academic and industrial communities in Poland and in Europe and establishing strategic intersectoral partnerships with the state and private sector.
